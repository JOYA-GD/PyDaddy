Package to analyse the characteristics of stochastic time series data.

# How does it work
Suppose m(t) is a stochastic time series data, then the package calculates the deterministic and stochastic component of dm/dt.

The method of extracting the deterministic and stochastic and deterministic functions is based on the assumption that the noise is uncorrelated and Gaussian in nature.

The package extracts the noise from the data and checks to make sure the noise is Gaussian and uncorrelated in nature. 


# Motivation
![](https://teelabiisc.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/cropped-fish-7.jpg)
This project is motivated by the study of group behaviour dynamics of animals, especially schooling fish.
The sample data distributed along with this package is gathered from experiments conducted by [TEElab, IISc](https://teelabiisc.wordpress.com/).

# Installation

    $ git clone https://github.com/tee-lab/pyFish.git
    $ cd pyFish
    $ python setup.py install
or

    $ python -m pip install git+https://github.com/tee-lab/pyFish.git

For developers:
Clone the repo:

    $ git clone https://github.com/ashwinkk23/pyFish.git
    $ cd pyFish
    $ python setup.py build
    $ python setup.py develop

# Usage

    pyFish.Characterize(...)
    Input params:
		data : list
			time series data to be analysed, data = [x] for scalar data and data = [x1, x2] for vector
			where x, x1 and x2 are of numpy.array object type
		t : numpy.array
			time stamp of time series
		t_int : float
			time increment between consecutive observations of the time series
		dt = 'auto' : 'auto' or int
			time scale to run the analysis on (for determinsitic part);
			algorithm estimates dt if 'auto' is passed, else takes the user input
		delta_t = 1 : int
			time scale to run the analysis on (for stochastic part)
		inc = 0.01 : float
			increment in order parameter for scalar data
		inc_x = 0.1 : float
			increment in order parameter for vector data x1
		inc_y = 0.1 : float
			increment in order parameter for vector data x2
		drift_order = None : int
			order of polynomial to be fit for calculated drift (deterministic part);
			if None, algorithim estimates the optimium drift_order
		diff_order = None : int
			order of polynomial to be fit for calculated diff (stochastic part);
			if None, algorithim estimates the optimium diff_order
		max_order = 10 : int
			maxmium drift_order and diff_order to consider
		fft = True : bool
			if true use fft method to calculate autocorrelation else, use standard method
		t_lag = 1000 : int
			maxmium lag to use to calculate acf
		**kwargs 
			All the parameters for pyFish.preporcessing and pyFish.noise_analysis


# Usage Example
Example loading sample data and storing all data and plots.

    # import modules
    >>> import pyFish
    >>> import pyFish.tests
    # load data
    >>> data = pyFish.tests.load_sample_data('data/ternary/N30.csv')
    >>> X, t = data.T
    # Analyse
    >>> analysed_output = pyFish.Characterize([X],t)
    Gaussian check for underlying noise: 100%|â–ˆ| 10000/10000 [00:00<00:00, 14393.3]
    # Save analysed data, plots, parameters to disk.
    >>> analysed_output.save_all_data(savepath='ternary_n30')
    Results saved in: ternary_n30/1600538555
   
The results will be saved in ``current/working/directory/ternary_n30/`` folder
